ThakurOS version 0.2
Notes: (vx.1) - CLI version of Thakur OS

Project restarted with following new update of ArchISO

ArchISO version 51-1

Build with mkarchiso command (remember to be root). Also remember to point to directory in which this repo is extractracted.  


NOTE: Thakur OS is undergoing alot of changes. The old-school way of doing things is evolving and starting to become accustomed to the new way things are going on at the moment. Part of this is due to the many changes happening within Arch. The new year is promising and however, would not be short of challenges.
